[Sniffnet](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet) is an open-source network monitoring tool to help everyone analyze their Internet traffic with ease.

## What makes it unique

Sniffnet is a **technical tool**, but at the same time it strongly focuses on the overall **user experience**: most of the network analyzers out there are cumbersome to use, while one of Sniffnet's cornerstones is to be **usable with ease by everyone**.

The gathered information is displayed in a clear and impactful way that makes it straightforward to have a look to what's flowing in a computer network card.

Furthermore, this application is totally developed in **Rust**: a modern programming language to build **efficient and reliable** software, emphasizing performance and safety.

Rust efficiency and reliability makes Sniffnet a perfectly fluid application even in presence of higher traffic loads and allows the app to be composed by multiple threads without incurring in problematic race conditions.

The application is cross-platform compatible with all the major operating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD... and more.

On the [official website](https://www.sniffnet.net/download) you can find more instructions on how to download the app for your OS.

## Star growth

Sniffnet is a very young application, but as shown by the Star History chart it had a stunning growth during the past months.

The main events that caused this astonishing growth are reported in the following:
- in November 2022, Sniffnet first stable version was released and it was featured in the overall GitHub trending page
- in April 2023, the application was announced to be selected for the [GitHub Accelerator Program](https://accelerator.github.com)
- in May 2023, Sniffnet was [featured on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35991811) front page

Sniffnet's growth is particularly impressive when compared with the other popular network analyzers, including Wireshark:

## Future development

Sniffnet is still on the way of being a complete network analyzer, but the traction it recently gained shows that the app has a huge potential.

Sniffnet is continuously maintained and new feature will be introduced in the future, such as support for ICMP, read and write of PCAP files, process IDs recognition, and more.

The project is open to corporate partnerships: if you are a company and believe in the project, you can [consider pioneering Sniffnet growth](https://github.com/sponsors/GyulyVGC).
