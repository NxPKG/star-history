As the de-facto site to check GitHub star history, [star-history.com](/) has been growing steadily over the
years. Today, it is welcoming 30,000+ unique visitors.

Comparing to other sites, this is an intimidating small number, while the open source talents density
here is high. Many open source project maintainers check our site routinely. Engineers and investors
also use our site to compare similar projects.

Many popular GitHub projects, in particular, from the recent AI wave, have also embedded our live
chart in their README.

Last year, we also started [Starlet List](/blog/list-your-open-source-project), a free program to promote
open source projects. Since then, we have received a lot of open source project nominations and have
compiled 18 issues.

To scale the community, today we introduce another endeavor, the star history forum at https://forum.star-history.com.
To retain the sketchy spirit, we use the discourse classic theme to build the forum.

Our star history editorial team will hang out there and pick interesting goodies to share with the
community. See you there!
